# DataFrames.jl

Welcome to the DataFrames documentation! This resource aims to teach you everything you need
to know to get up and running with tabular data manipulation using the DataFrames.jl package
and the Julia language. If there is something you expect DataFrames to be capable of, but
cannot figure out how to do, please reach out with questions in Domains/Data on
[Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/new-topic?title=[DataFrames%20Question]:%20&body=%23%20Question:%0A%0A%23%20Dataset%20(if%20applicable):%0A%0A%23%20Minimal%20Working%20Example%20(if%20applicable):%0A&category=Domains/Data&tags=question).
Please report bugs by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/issues/new). You can follow
the [**source**]() links throughout the documentation to jump right to the
source files on GitHub to make pull requests for improving the documentation and function
capabilities. Please review
[DataFrames contributing guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before submitting your first PR! Information on specific versions can be found on the [Release page](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl/releases).
